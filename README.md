## Project Overview

This project uses a linear regression model to predict delivery time based on various factors such as distance, number of items, and dasher availability. The goal is to analyze and model delivery data to understand key influences on delivery efficiency.

## Key Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection (RFE)
- Linear regression model building using scikit-learn
- Residual and coefficient analysis
- Interpretation of results and answers to subjective questions

---

## Assumptions

- Missing values handled appropriately.
- Outliers removed using IQR method.
- Features engineered from datetime columns.
- Final model uses top 8 features based on RFE.

---

## Outcomes

- Achieved an RÂ² score of ~0.86.
- Distance, total items, and order hour were identified as top predictors of delivery time.
